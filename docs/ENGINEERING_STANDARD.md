# Engineering Standard (A+)

## Core Principles
- Correctness over cleverness
- Readability is a feature
- Maintainability over optimisation

## Functions
- Single responsibility
- Prefer early returns
- Keep functions small

## Naming
- Names explain intent
- Booleans start with is / has / can / should

## Errors
- Never swallow errors
- Errors must include context

## Tests
- Behaviour-focused
- No testing implementation details

## EAS Development Build Startup Rules (Critical)

The following rules are **non-negotiable** when diagnosing startup crashes:

1. **EAS development builds never load static JavaScript bundles.**
   - Static bundles generated by `expo export`
   - `static-build/ios`
   - `static-build/android`
   are **NOT used** by EAS development builds.
   Missing or empty static bundle folders are **NOT a valid cause** of startup failure.

2. **Startup crashes must be diagnosed as native or import-time JavaScript failures.**
   Valid causes include:
   - Import-time exceptions (module-level throws)
   - Invalid or missing exports
   - Native module initialization failures
   - Reanimated / New Architecture bootstrap issues
   - Side effects executed before React renders

3. **SAFE verdicts require evidence.**
   - If no concrete error message with file + line number is available,
     the verdict MUST be **UNKNOWN**, not SAFE.
   - In such cases, instrumentation must be requested (e.g. boot beacon).

Any analysis that violates these rules is considered invalid.
